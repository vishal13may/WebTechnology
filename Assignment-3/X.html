	<p>Pig and Pig Latin</p>
	<br>
	<p>Pig was intially developed at Yahoo! to allow people using
		Apache Hadoop&#174 to focus more on analyzing large data sets and
		spend less time having to write mapper and reducer programs.Like
		actual pigs,who eat almost anything, the Pig programming language is
		designed to handle any kind of data-hence the name!.</p>

	<p>Pig is made up of two components: the first is the language
		itself,which is called PigLatin (yes, people naming various Hadoop
		projects to tend to have a sense of humor associated with their naming
		conventions), and the second is a runtime environment where PigLatin
		programs are executed.Think of the relaiton between a Java Virtual
		Machine(JVM) and a Java application. In this section,we'll just refer
		to the whole entity as Pig.</p>
